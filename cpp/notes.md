# size_t

< cstddef >, < stddef.h >

unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator

std::size_t	can store the maximum size of an object of any type (including array).  
std::size_t	can store the value of any non-member pointer, in which case it is synonymous with std::uintptr_t.  
An exception is systems with segmented addressing.
